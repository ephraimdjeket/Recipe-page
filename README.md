# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview
This project is a challenge from the Frontend Mentor website, where the goal was to build a specific website. I approached the development with a mobile-first strategy, then adapted it for desktop. Since I didn't have access to the Figma files for this challenge, I relied on the provided image for design guidance.
